# Compute Lab 174: Scale and Load Balance your Architecture

## Overview
In this lab, I learned to use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to distribute traffic across multiple instances and automatically scale my infrastructure based on demand.  

## Objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:  
1. Create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance.  
2. Create a load balancer to distribute traffic.  
3. Create a launch template for EC2 instances.  
4. Create and configure an Auto Scaling group in private subnets.  
5. Monitor performance using CloudWatch alarms.  
6. Test auto scaling by simulating high load.  

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2  
- Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)  
- Auto Scaling  
- Amazon CloudWatch  
- Security Groups  
- VPC, Subnets, and Availability Zones

## Pre-requisites
- A running EC2 instance (Web Server 1) in a public subnet.  
- Configured VPC with public and private subnets.  
- Pre-created Web Security Group allowing HTTP access.  

## Steps Taken
   1. **Create an AMI for Auto Scaling**

      1.1 Choose existing EC2 instance

      1.2 Select Actions > Image and templates > Create image, then configure the following
      ```
      Image name: Web Server AMI
      Image description: Lab AMI for Web Server
      ```
      1.3 Choose **Create Image**

   2. **Creating a load balancer**
   
   2.1  Create an **Application Load Balancer** with the following configuration:
   ```
   Load balancer name: LabELB
   VPC: Lab VPC
   Mappings: choose both AZs listed
   Security groups: Web Security Group
   Listeners and routing: lab-target-group
   ```
   2.2 Choose **Create load balancer**

   3. **Creating a launch template**

   3.1 Find and choose **Create launch template** using the following configuration:
   ```
   Launch template name: lab-app-launch-template
   Template version description: a web server for the load test app
   
   ```

   4. **Creating an Auto Scaling group**
   5. **Verify that load balancing is working**
   6. **Testing auto scaling**

## Cleanup
- Terminated any unnecessary EC2 instances.  
- Deleted the load balancer and Auto Scaling group to avoid extra costs.  

## Wrap-up
In this lab, I successfully:
- Built scalable and highly available architecture using ELB and Auto Scaling.
- Gained practical experience creating AMIs, configuring load balancers and setting up Auto Scaling groups.
